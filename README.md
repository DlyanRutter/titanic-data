analyzing titanic dataset

You will need the following python modules installed: pylab, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, and scikit learn
The complete dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
The Kaggle dataset is split into training and testing sets.
The dataset I included in titanic_data.csv is not split into training and testing sets.

This script allows you to check the liklihood a passenger survived the titanic sinking based on various features
such as sex, age, passenger class, fare, #family members, family relations, Port of Embarkation, cabin number, and ticket number. See https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data for further details regarding the featureset.  

In addition to machine learning classifiers, there are functions to check the accuracy of predictions. There is also a function that will allow you to plot a decision boundary.
